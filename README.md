# Many to Many Relationships

## Getting Started

Once you clone the repo, install dependencies and run migrations, you'll need to run a seeder to get some dummy data in your database.

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/patrickodacre/simple-api-adonis-js.git

# If on Master branch...
git checkout lucid_many_to_many

npm install
```
